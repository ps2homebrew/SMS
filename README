Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Simple Media System (SMS) is a result of my curiosity about Sony's Playstation2,
MIPS, DivX and MP3. My original goal was to create a simplest DivX player able
to play good resolution movies at good frame rate on the unmodded PS2 without
any extra equipment such as HDD and network adapter. Why "system"? Just because
having only a player program is not enough. Since PS2 is forced to ignore "illegal"
disks, I've took an idea of Drakonite with his UMCDR and developed my own "UMCDR".
(I called it CDDAFS). It just stores data on CD audio disk, which can be read on
(I hope) any PS2. So this is a first component of SMS. Second component is a PC
program that makes cue/bin files in order to burn such a disk. And, finally, comes
a player program itself. This system is not complete yet, but it can play DivX movies
with sound at good frame rate already. Player's base is a famous ffmpeg project.
I took just some parts of it (DivX 5XX and MP3) and made some modifications specific
to PS2 hardware. I've tested it with a couple of DivX/XviD movies with different
screen resolutions and encoding methods and it seems to be working. So, I've decided
to put all this stuff to the CVS at ps2dev in hope that it could be interesting for
PS2 enthusiasts who use it as base for their development. This "document" provides
basic info about SMS.

 CDDAFS
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
It's just a method of storing a data on audio CD, so PS2 hardware can authenticate
such a CD as "valid" one. Logical structure of such a CD is quite simple. Audio tracks
are "directories". Track 0 is a control track, which stores global disk information.
Following "diagram" presents a logical disk structure:

Track 0:
GUID             - 16  bytes
Disk name        - 64  bytes
Disk description - 512 bytes
Disk picture     - 9216 bytes (48x48x4 raw RGB image)*
; then follows image table
Number of images - 2 bytes (short, little endian)*
Image 1          - 4096 bytes (32*32*4 raw RGB image)*
.......
Image N          - 4096 bytes (32*32*4 raw RGB image)*
; then follows "directory" table (number of directories is number of tracks from
; CD TOC minus one)
Track name        1 - 32 bytes
Track image index 1 -  2 bytes (short, little endian, zero based)
Reserved          1 - 30 bytes (just for possible future enhancements)
Track name        2 - 32 bytes
Track image index 2 -  2 bytes (short, little endian, zero based)
Reserved          2 - 30 bytes (just for possible future enhancements)
.......
Other tracks:
; Directory entry 1
Number of files     -  2 bytes (short, little endian)
File name           - 32 bytes
File image index    -  2 bytes (short, little endian, zero based)
Reserved            - 30 bytes
Start offset        -  4 bytes (physical sector relative to start sector of
                                the current track, int, little endian, zero based
                               )
File size(in bytes) -  4 bytes (int, little endian)
; Directory entry 2
; etc.
; File data

* these "pictures" and "images" are in fact RGBA raw bitmaps, so future browser
  can be decorated with them;

Such a disk (without extra ECC codes) proved reliable enough in my configuration.
Source code that handles CD I/O located in CDDA.c (low level sector read operations)
and in FileContext.c (logical read operations). I've also started implementation of
"standard" I/O (STIO_xxx routines). Well, for me CDDA is enough. So anyone can
finish "standard" I/O (perhaps, using asynchronous fileXio routines from ps2sdk).

 PC program
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
I've called it CDXplorer. Not fully completed yet, but it does its job of
making cue/bin pair. This program is uses Win32 API, so it is not compatible with
linux (even WINE has troubles running it). I'm using Nero's Disk-At-Once/96 burning
option. It is also possible to read CDDAFS using this proggy. Just insert CDDAFS disk
in the drive and run the program. Maybe someone would like to create fs driver to
support it :)?

 SMS Player
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Just a test program for now and PS2 optimized ffmpeg. No GUI. It is possible to
benchmark video/audio decoding process (I've got sometimes peak ~70 fps with
640x464 movie (~60fps is average)). I was able to play 720x528 DivX with sound
at 25fps (but in this case there're slight sound distortions on scenes with a
lot of motions (mainly "global" ones). Just watching a movie is also possible.
Modify main's source at your taste. For sound output I'm using 'audsrv' 0.75
(magnificent work of gawd).

 ffmpeg modifications
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Two things here. Using IPU for colorspace conversion (interrupt driven process that
performs CSC->Display sequence for 640x464 picture in just ~4ms). This process goes
in parallel with video/audio decoding. Second, I've made a transition from planar
image format to the packed one, so video decoder produces macroblocks in IPU format.
This notable reduced data traffic between main CPU and memory. SPR is also
heavily used in conjunction with DMA transfers. This things gave ~300% performance
boost (comparing to the original ffmpeg) in video decoding. MP3 decoder is virtually
unmodified.

 Things to do
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
There still a lot to do. As I'm a professional programmer, I just can't do this
alone quickly. SMS is just a working skeleton of the future player. I've created it
in my own free time. The following things I'd like to do with it:
- more testing (I've tested it with just about a dozen of DivX/XviD movies);
- more optimizations (mainly for GMC decoding. I've made just an 'ad hoc' code to
  show that it works. But this code is ugly and slow). QPel works, but it is
  unoptimized too (just an original ffmpeg). The MP3 decoder from ffmpeg is also
  almost untouched;
- better A/V synchronization. In fact there's no synchronization at all.
  But because multithreading on PS2 is not preemptive it happens
  "automatically" with a surprisingly good accuracy :). The only thing to
  fix was initial "audio preload". I'm not sure if I made it correctly, but
  it seems to be working at the moment. Realtime clock with 1ms resolution is
  also implemented, so it could be used for more precise synchronization;
- creation of the GUI. In case of CDDAFS it would be just a disk browser.
  There's already a base for it. There're routines to use ROM font (FONTM) and display
  icons from CDDAFS disk. There're also routines to load directory/file lists.
  The only thing missing is a pad management and an event loop;
- implementation of pause/stop functionality; As movie starts, there's no way back now;
- error checking (there're minimal checks only, so if, for example, press
  'eject' CD button, then...a very interesting effect can be achieved :);
- btw, can somebody modify Makefile in order to make whole project more structured
  (all these 'ee', 'iop' etc. directories)? 

 Restrictions
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
- no support for interlaced movies;
- no support for non-interleaved avi files;
- only CodecID_MPEG4 support (that is DivX 5XX/XviD (I never, however, tried
  these 'MP4S', 'BLZ0' etc. (what are they?)) and MP3;
- other possible restrictions due to lack of detailed knowledge about things :);

 How to compile
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm using latest toolchain/ps2sdk from ps2dev and Win32 platform. Just 'make'.
Do not use 'old' ps2sdk (earlier than january 2005), since there's a bug in
'realloc', so program crashes immediately. In my setup I use ps2link at PS2 side
and InLink at the PC. Note also that performace depends on PS2 cache usage,
so even changing link order in Makefile can get more than 10% penalty (
Currently Makefile contains 'best' link order (I think so). Pay attention to
the location of 'audsrv.irx' (currently 'host:audsrv.irx').

 How to debug
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Crazy enough, but I've made the code Win32 compatible (with exception of some
files). So, I'm using MSVC6 to debug major bugs, memory leaks and to understand
ffmpeg's code. 'printf' does debug for PS2 :);

 How to make modifications
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
At your taste (be careful, any alignment failure causes a crash (especially with
structures allocated dynamically)). But first compile and run existing code (the only
thing to modify is a filename in 'main.c'). To do that it's necessary to waste at least
one CD-R for CDDAFS. Use CDXplorer application to make cue/bin pair. It is possible
to copy files back from CDDAFS disk. Drag-and-drop is supported (one direction only:
to the application). Context menus are also available. Number of directories has upper
limit of 99 (only one level), and number of files is restricted by the CD capacity
(I've put a 800MB movie, for example, on the ordinary 700MB disk without any problem).
I have SCPH-30004R PAL unit, so it works at least on this model.

 Modified ps2sdk code
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
It could be noted that there's a lot of modified ps2sdk code here. Why?
I wanted maximum performance. For 'audsrv' for example there's an unnecessary
(I think so) calls for memcpy and FlushCache. 'libcdvd' caused strange problems
of data corruprion when SifLoadModule was called. GSkit uses SPR badly needed
for video decoding. Instead, I decode MP3 stream directly to the uncached, 64 byte
aligned memory, I'm using 64 byte aligned buffers for disk I/O, and GS kit was
modified to avoid SPR usage. Maybe I'm just a stupid person :o).

 License
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
For my code it is the same as for ps2sdk (AFL). For ffmpeg -
"GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation;
either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version" :).

 Miscellaneous
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
I've made this just for myself. I don't want to make any profit from it.
Anyone is free to make anything with it (according to aforementioned licenses).
If my code sucks (especially my formatting habits) - it sucks. I don't care.
I just hope that it will help PS2 enthusiasts to make their programs quicker.
I will continue slowly to make it more like a real system, but for me alone
it will take ages to finish it :).

Update (16-JUN-2005)
--------------------
STIO_XXX routines are implemented. Though not fully tested, but at least I was
able to play a file using 'host:file.avi' syntax. Loading goes slower than from
CDDAFS but movie plays OK. This feature can be helpful for programmers (no need
anymore to make CD :)). Well, these STIO_XXX routines call 'fioxxx' from ps2sdk,
so, alas, no hdd support. Anyone is free to replace 'fioxxx' by 'fileXioxxx' and
try it with hdd. To use 'STIO_XXX' just replace 'CDDA_InitFileContext' call by
'STIO_InitFileContext' (and remove other CDDA_XXX calls).

Update (19-JUN-2005)
--------------------
HDD support added. All requred .irx modules are loaded from memory (They reside in
SMS_Data.c (Note that data buffer is then reused by audio decompressor)).
HDD partition "SMS_Media" (FS_GROUP_COMMON) is mounted automatically. Finally fixed
ring buffers issue (the problem was main's thread priority (I thought it is 1 by default,
but 'ps2link' sets it to 64)). Now it explicitly set to 1. Changed audio decompression
buffer (I'm preparing A/V synchronization in such a way that there will be two more
queues with already decompressed audio/video frames (I'm not sure yet if it will work
at all :)). Audio preload functionality is removed (no need of it as my idea with A/V
sync will not depend on it). I don't know at the moment how USB devices work with ps2sdk,
so any help will be appreciated. Project structure is also reorganized.

Update (28-JUN-2005)
--------------------
Some MP3 bugs (typoes) fixed. New FONTM autokerning algorithm is implemented (strings look
much nicer now). 'audsrv' updated. Region autodetection code is added to the GS code.

Update (03-JUL-2005)
--------------------
A very primitive A/V syncronization added. Video output V-Blank synchronization added.

Update (15-JUL-2005)
--------------------
At last I've added a GUI and pause/stop functionality, so it looks more like a real program.
Here's short manual:
- SMS screen is divided in 3 areas: device menu at the top, file menu in the middle and
  status line at the bottom;
- each area is bounded by a red rectangle with round corners;
- device menu and file menu can be activated;
- active menu is bounded by a white rectangle;
- device menu is navigated by "left" and "right" pad buttons;
- "down" pad button switches from device menu to the file menu;
- file menu is navigated by "up" and "down" pad buttons;
- "left" or "right" pad button switches from file menu to the device menu;
- active item in both menus is highlighted by semitransparent rectangle;
- selection is made by pressing "cross" pad button;
- "triangle" pad button navigates one level up (directory->parent directory->partition list)
  in the file menu;
- menu items with different contexts (file/directory/partition) are represented by
  different icons;
- CDDAFS disks are recognized automatially (just insert it and wait for a while);
- during playback use "select" pad button to pause, "start" to resume and "triangle"
  to stop and return to the filebrowser;
- press "select" and "circle" pad buttons in the filebrowser to switch PS2 off;
That's it. Note, that during that "harsh stop action" no IOP reset, program restart etc.
is performed. So, memory and other resource leaks etc. are possible (I've tried to be
as accurate as possible but who knows ;)). No USB mass-stoarge device support, since my
only USB memory stick doesn't work with ps2sdk tests. Note also, that I've changed that
magic MAGV, MAGH and other numbers in GS.c to get nice aligned picture on my TV and TV
tuner card (SMS in NTSC mode also works there). If anyone has a problems with improperly
aligned picture - just play around with these numbers. VESA modes are not tested at all
(perhaps I'll try to play with it).

Another thing: as this become more or less complete version there could be a huge mess
with distributed versions. There are two choises here: maintain only one version or change
something to make a difference. I personally don't believe in choise 1. So, SVN will also
contain a precompiled SMS.elf (let's call it "reference executable"). There's a function
called 'GUIStub_DrawBackground' which is empty in SVN (in my case it draws a gradient
background, animation and version number (currently 1.0 Rev.2)). Different "distributors"
would implement their own "signature" by implementing aforementioned function
(its parameter gives an access to the GSContext etc.), so people will know who's
to blame ;)). Anyone is welcome to send me code modifications, so I'll update SVN.
There's still an optimization potential (GMC, MP3, for example) if someone thinks that
SMS is too slow. For audio issues, please, contact 'gawd', the creator of 'audsrv'
(32000 upsampler does not exist, for example). Better A/V sync could also be implemented
(the existing one is rather primitive (though, it works in most cases)).
There're a dosen of various DivX/XviD encoding parameters and their combinations etc.
I just could not handle them alone, sorry for that.

Update (20-JUL-2005)
--------------------
Fiexed bugs:
- movie stop action does not work always;
- movie freezes after some time when launched via LaunchElf;
- motion compenstation does not perform properly for some motion types;

New features:
- saved file browser state when selecting partition/directory;
- screen adjustments actions added:
    select-R1 - move right;
    select-L1 - move left;
    select-R2 - move down;
    select-L2 - move up;
- save configuration (select-SQUARE) action added ("mc0:/SMS" directory)
  (currntly screen settings and HDD mounted partition name);
- MP3 optimization added (assembly source from BroadQ) - audio decoding
  performance increased by ~30%;
- new version number - 1.1 ;);

Update (23-JUL-2005)
-------------------
- added "exit to the ps2 browser" action (select-TRIANGLE);
- tried to fix difficult-to-catch (thread stuff) "movie stop action does not work always";
- USB support added (thanks and regards to 'weltall'):
  USBD.IRX is not included (licensing issues). SMS looks for it in:
  - host:USBD.IRX
  - mc0:/BOOT/USBD.IRX
  - mc0:/PS2OSCFG/USBD.IRX
  - mc0:/SYS-CONF/USBD.IRX
  - mc0:/PS2MP3/USBD.IRX
  - mc0:/BOOT/PS2MP3/USBD.IRX
  - mc0:/SMS/USBD.IRX
  *** in aforementioned order ***;
  I'm using legal USBD.IRX from Playstation 2's Linux kit.

Note: there's modified usb_mass.irx integrated into SMS. I've made it in
order to get my USB flash drive (Apacer Handy Steno HT202 128MB USB2.0)
working. Hot swapping apparently works also in my case. Any remarks are
welcome. NO WARRANTY THAT USB FUNCTIONALITY WILL BEHAVE PROPERLY WITH OTHER DEVICES.

Update (31-JUL-2005)
--------------------
- another algorithm of A/V syncronization implemented;
- some bugs hopefully fixed :);
- video output V-Blank synchronization scheme changed;

Update (07-AUG-2005)
--------------------
- an attempt to fix a bug due to XviD's packed bitstream;
- translational global motion compensation routine is rewritten
  using EE's MMI. I'm not sure if it will be really noticeable
  but tests show that new routine is >4x faster than the original
  C code;

Update (13-AUG-2005)
--------------------
- got rid of the spontaneous noise (audsrv's problem);
- "player hangs on movie stop" bug fixed (thanks to 'Mr. Worm~~' for being
  patient with testing);
- got rid of "Paused" message by holding "select" button for > 200ms;
- performance slightly improved for some cases (avoiding calculations
  of skipped macroblocks);
- added video mode selection at program's startup
  (select-R1 for NTSC, select-R2 for PAL). Timeout is 1 second, then
  (if no aforementioned pad button combinations were pressed)
  program continues with default video mode (from saved configuration or
  autodetected one);

Update (19-AUG-2005)
--------------------
- AC3 audio decoder added. Absolutely unoptimized yet (just an original
  C code) but at least appears to be working (thanks to 'Mr. Worm~~' for
  his test video clips);
- Filebrowser's font color changed to yellow (an idea of 'Mr. Worm~~' again);
- 'DSP_PutPixels8XY2' and 'DSP_PutPixels16XY2' routines are rewritten in
  assembly using MMI;
- Some other changes that could be interesting only for programmers;

Update (26-AUG-2005)
--------------------
- Ronald Andersson (AKA: dlanor) has added network (host) support
  (thanks and regards to him):
- ISO CD/DVD support added (thanks to 'Mr. Worm~~' for real help in testing);
- Added MPEG2 unquantizer (fixes bad video quality issues in some cases)
  (this thing is to be optimized with MMI, anyone can try his (her) skills
   with MIPS/EE assembly ;) (thanks to 'koki373737' for his video clips);
- Added an ability to choose between interlaced and non-interlaced video
  signal at program's startup (select-R1-square - for non-interlaced NTSC
  and select-R2-square for non-intrlaced PAL);
- Attempt to fix "movie dimensions must be dividable by 16" issue. I've only
  tested it with height of 396 pixels, but I hope that it will work in other
  cases too (thanks to 'koki373737' again for his video clips);

Update (02-SEP-2005)
--------------------
- 'usb_mass.irx' updated (thanks to 'hip203' for source code of 'LaunchElf');
- AC3 sound is made louder (thanks to 'Mr. Worm~~' for playing with it);
- slightly improved performance ("CSC - display" cycle (IPU code) is shortened
  and some code is rewritten in assembly);
- removed "black bars" on the left and right sides of the picture for some movies
  with "incorrect" aspect ratios;

Update (21-SEP-2005)
--------------------
- DVD video disks support added (an ability to read .avi files from DVD video disks
  on "unmodded" consoles). New CDVD.IRX (supporting UDF filesystem) allows that.

Update (29-SEP-2005 "Birthday edition" :))
--------------------
- Added support for following codecs:
  'DIV3', 'MP43', 'MPG3', 'DIV5', 'DIV6', 'DIV4', 'AP41', 'COL1', 'COL0';
- Slightly changed 'audsrv' (an attempt to solve spontaneous "hangings");
- Some changes in the source code to prepare OSD support etc.;

Update (07-OCT-2005)
--------------------
- Changed/rewritten 'audsrv':
    - removed CDDA stuff (not used);
    - reduced data traffic;
    - upsamplers rewritten in assembler;
  Result: improved performance -> no sound crackling during network playback;
- Volume control is implemented (up/down buttons);
- AVI demuxer changed (OpenDML support (not tested - I don't have any .avi ot that type));
- General demuxer code is redesigned (this can make life easier for programmers
  who want to implement different file formats support);

Update (15-OCT-2005)
--------------------
- Fixed bug in cdvd.irx/UDF filesystem code;
- New audio upsampling routine is implemented. It employs linear interpolation
  algorithm and it still works at the IOP side (it uses no division instructions).
  It sould also support other sample rates (at least 32000 does work at my site);

Update (30-OCT-2005)
--------------------
- Attempt to fix misterious SifRpc/fioRead problem (decreased buffer size);
- Yet another A/V syncronization algorithm is implemented;
- Fixed a typo bug caused really bad A/V sync in some cases;
- Added movie "scrolling" actions:
  - "right"    pad button - "scroll" forward;
  - "left"     pad button - "scroll" backward;
  - "cross"    pad button - terminate "scrolling" and continue playing;
  - "triangle" pad button - terminate "scrolling" and return to the browser;
  This "scrolling" begins at 3 seconds intervals looking for closest keyframe
  which is displayed (so 3 seconds is only a hint, it can become, for example,
  20 or more/less actual seconds depending on keyframe locations). Pressing
  "left"/"right" while "scrolling" increases/ decreases intervals by 3 seconds
  (for forward "scrolling" "right" button increases interval and "left" button
  decreases it, for backward "scrolling" it's the other way around). Minimum
  value for the "scrolling" interval is 3 sec. Maximum is 1 min and 3 sec. If
  "scrolling" reaches begin of the movie then it begins to play from the beginning.
  Reaching end of the movie causes exit to the browser. Reaction time to pad
  buttons depends on the media speed etc., so sometimes it's necessary to hold
  buttons for a while for the response. At the beginning of "scrolling" and at the
  end of it some pause can happen (flush file buffers and termination of pending
  I/O requests) which again depends on the device speed. It is also possible to
  "wrap" scrolling process, for example, if while "scrolling" forward "left" button
  was pressed at the minimum "scrolling" interval then backward "scrolling" begins
  and vise versa. Note, that during "scrolling" image distortion can occur ("square"
  arifacts etc., I don't have any interest to investigate reasons for it :) ).
  Anyone is free to implement more advanced seeking functionality with time scale,
  "mouse" pointers etc. Current implementation permits "jumps" to arbitrary movie
  location (time based), so it can be easly reused for these "advanced" actions;
- added support for second gamepad. Thanks to 'bix64' for research and
  implementation;
- added very basic support for background image (skin) in the browser. Thanks to
  'bix64' for research and implementation. Skin file is a DivX5xx/XviD encoded
  I-Frame. It must be "mc0:SMS/skin.sms" file and it must have 640x512 dimensions;

Update (12-NOV-2005)
--------------------
- new font is introduced. It is internationalized and
  there's a possibility to choose "codepages". Four "codepages" are available:
  WinLatin1, WinLatin2, WinCyrillic and WinGreek.
  Thanks to "Mr.Worm~~" for the cool font utility;
- SMS menu is implemented ("start" pad button) providing configuration options etc.
  Thanks to "bix64" for the code, "Mr.Worm~~", "rathunter" and "HypERSoniC" for ideas;
  Note on color selection: to make life easier for me :) I've made a 16 color palette
  (standard CGA colors), so there's a color choice from these 16 colors. It's possible
  to customize this palette by providing "mc0:SMS/SMS.pal" file. It should be a binary
  file of 64 bytes length. Each color takes 4 bytes (R,G,B,A);
- Fixed small issue with "Initializing SMS..." message when there's no media
  available (thanks to "jacky401" and "Mr. Worm~~" for note and research);

Update (24-DEC-2005 "Christmas edition" :))
--------------------
- subtitles support is added for .srt (SubRip) and .sub (MicroDVD) formats. Subtitle
  files are recognized automatically by file extension (".srt" has precedence over
  ".sub") as they are located at the same place as .avi file and have the same name.
  Subtitles can be switched on/off via player menu. Note that this support is rather
  strict in sense that no advanced text parsing was implemented, so subtitle file must
  follow specifications (for .srt refer http://www.matroska.org). In case of "Subtitle
  error" message refer displayed number as line number near the place where error
  condition was detected. If subtitle line is too long to fit the screen it will be
  splitted (by word) in two or more lines (space character is treated as word separator).
  Thanks to "BraveDog" for the research/implementation, "Mr.Worm~~" for advises
  and testing and "mastaalien" for remark about long subtitle lines;
- player menu is introduced ("start" button during playback);
- multi-audio support is added (if multiple sudio streams are present in the .avi file).
  Note that all audio streams have to be encoded using same codec and same codec settings,
  otherwise results are unpredictable :). Language can be changed via player menu;
  Thanks to "Mr.Worm~~" for sample clip;
- SMS menu is extended with new options ("circle" pad button can also be used for action
  (for numeric input it reverses "scrolling" direction));
- external font support added. Following fonts can be loaded:
  - mc0:SMS/ascii.mtf    - contains  96 ascii    characters ( 32-127)
  - mc0:SMS/latin2.mtf   - contains 128 latin2   characters (128-255)
  - mc0:SMS/cyrillic.mtf - contains 128 cyrillic characters (128-255)
  - mc0:SMS/latin1.mtf   - contains 128 latin1   characters (128-255)
  - mc0:SMS/greek.mft    - contains 128 greek    characters (128-255)
  New font can be created by 'MTKFontCreator' utility (google) (I've used version 0.6.2).
  During font save select "Save Mediatek Font -> 4 color comp., variable width (NEW mode)".
  Min height must be set to 32. During font generation Max Width and Height parameters
  (displayed on the status line) must not exceed 32. No error checks etc. are performed
  by SMS here, so use it very carefully and on your own risk :). Probably .ini file
  for that utility has to be adjusted on site in order to generate reduced character sets
  (96 and 128 characters instead of 256). By changing that .ini file it's possible to
  create virtually any character sets (ISO-8859-7, for instance);
- pan-scan display is implemented. By default SMS displays movie in letterbox mode
  (widescreen movies are shown in full width). 3 pan-scan modes are available (via player
  menu or "square" pad button during playback). In pan-scan mode it's possible to scroll
  picture left or right using "L1"/"R1" pad buttons ("L1"+"R1" resets changes);
- "about" screen is added ("L1"+"R1"+"R2"+"L2" pad buttons in the browser);
- ps2host.irx driver is updated (fixed "DVD hang" issue on some consoles);
- fixed bug (only one file can be opened) in cdvd.irx;
- playback time OSD added ("cross" button during playback);
- auto poweroff timer added (start counting from the moment of pad button press).
  "auto" mode there means "poweroff when movie ends";
- fixed bug "mounted partition saved in the configuration when there's no partition
  mounted. Thanks to JuddMan for the remark;
- audio/video and subtitle/video manual synchronization added. "circle" pad button
  activates OSD for it and "L2"/"R2" adjusts time delay (from -5sec to 5sec (for
  subtitles from -30sec to 30sec) with 250ms interval);
- basic and primitive mp3/m3u playback support added with silly "ballsim" demo :);
- bug fixed (sceen offset adjustment settings is saved incorrectly) - thanks to
  'dave_t' for the fix;
- video timeline/scrollbar added. This option is configurable and activated by "select"
  pad button during playback (instead of pause). The use "left"/"right" pad buttons
  to set new time offset, "start"/"cross" pad button(s) to resume playback. Thanks to
  bix64 for the implementation;
- enabled support of VESA video modes: 640x480@60Hz ("select+L1" pad buttons at startup)
  and 640x480@75Hz ("select+L2" pad buttons at startup). Tested only with ViewSonic VX910
  TFT monitor with official Sony's cable. These modes are not selectable via SMS menu to
  avoid confusions :);
- fixed bug upsampler routine ("ticking" noise with sample rates < 48KHz);
- new bugs have been "implemented" ;);

Update (31-DEC-2005 "New Year edition" :))
--------------------
- fixed "hang" bug during m3u playback (thanks to "Mr.Worm~~" for nice Spanish
  music);
- fixed "subtitles are out of sync after scroll operations (using scrollbar)" bug (thanks
  to "Mr.Worm~~" for the remark);
- fixed "hang on loading .sub format subtitles" bug (thanks to "LaptoniC" for the remark);
- opaque subtitles support is added (thanks to "HUB107" for the note);
- added "support" for ".SRT" and ".SUB" (capital letters) subtitles;
- slightly changed AC3 decoder to get rid of some "effects" (thanks to "firehawk" for
  the research);
- removed garbage at the bottom of screen;
- added "fullscreen display" player option (thanks to "deank" for the note);
- fixed "movie jumps backward when resuming from pause using scrollbar" bug (thanks to
  "Mr.Worm~~" for the remark);

Update (01-JAN-2006)
--------------------
- fixed "first letter is missing" for "sub" subtitles format bug (thanks to
  "LaptoniC" and "deank" for remarks);
- fixed "SMS crashes when an unsupported file is selected" (thanks to "deank"
  for the remark);
- added "save display mode (letterbox/pan-scan)" feature; (thanks to "deank"
  for the remark);

Update (16-JAN-2006)
--------------------
- fixed bug in MP3 decoder - sound quality is improved (thanks to "Mr.Worm~~"
  and "Voldemar_u2" for testing);
- another attempt has been made to fix hang during m3u playback/scroll;
- relaxed format interpretation for .srt subtitles. Thanks to "Voldemar_u2"
  for the implementation;

Update (19-FEB-2006)
--------------------
- GS related code is rewritten from scratch (no VESA video mode support yet);
- Browser and GUI are rewritten (same look and feel, but totally different code
  featuring "object oriented" desktop, so, new GUI objects can be added without
  changing other parts of the application);
- Scalable fonts are implemented, so, subtitle size is adjustable now;
- Multilanguage support is implemented. Custom language strings are loaded from
  mc0:/SMS/SMS.lng file (which is just a text file);
- Skin format is changed slightly, so, it's possible to create skins of arbitrary
  size using updated version of "SMS Skin generator" application. Old skins are not
  supported anymore. Don't use a very high resulution (> 800x600) skins, otherwise
  results are not guaranteed. Note: new filename for skin is "mc0:/SMS/SMS.skn"
  (for consistency with other filenames like "SMS.lng" and "SMS.pal");
- Added functionality to select custom subtitles. This works as follows: pressing
  "circle" pad button while .avi file is selected activates a "mini-browser" with
  .sub/.srt files found in the same directory as .avi. If there're no .sub/.srt
  files found then playback begins instantly. Pressing "triangle" pad button while
  in "mini-browser" cancels selection, and starts playback with default subtitle
  selection algorithm (same name as .avi etc.). Pressing "cross" or "circle" button
  while in "mini-browser" selects subtitle and starts playback;
- .avi files with associated subtitles are displayed using different icon;
- added a possibility to launch user defined application upon exit. There're 3
  options: boot browser and 2 user defined (in SMS.lng) applications (default
  are "mc0:/BOOT/BOOT.ELF" and "mc0:/B?DATA-SYSTEM/BOOT.ELF). This feature is still
  experimental one, so, results are not guaranteed and the only supported media for
  launched programs is memory card and CD-ROM (not tested).
  (thanks to "Marcus R. Brown" for the loader code example); 
- some new configuration options are added (thanks to "bix64" for IPCONFIG.DAT
  "editor");
- some other "cosmetic" changes are made;
  Thanks to "Mr.Worm~~" for suggestions and testing;

Update (21-FEB-2006)
--------------------
- an attempt to fix "can't browse folders" bug;
  (thanks to everybody involved in this discovery);
- an attempt to fix "files on USB device are not selectable" bug;
- added possibility to decrease screen height in "display settings" ->
  "advanced settings" menu (thanks to "Voldemar_u2" for suggestion);

Update (22-FEB-2006)
--------------------
- fixed "Display subtitles" checkmark issue in player menu;
- fixed error reporting issue (too long messages leave onscreen artefacts);
- changed IOP reset routine (thanks to "dlanor" for the research/note);
- disabled internal queue locks by removing -DLOCK_QUEUES macro from the
  Makefile (it appears that queue locks are not needed since threads are
  non-preemptive anyway);

Update (23-FEB-2006)
--------------------
- changed loader code in attempt to fix "hangings" upon exit to
  user defined aplication;

Update (03-MAR-2006)
--------------------
- fixed incorrect subtitle position for multiline subtitles (thanks to
  "Voldemar_u2" for the note);
- sound made louder a bit (SPU2 volume values are adjusted);
- changed character indentation;
- added separate management for image offsets in different video modes
  (thanks to "Mr. Worm~~" and "Voldemar_u2" for the suggestion);
- added sound effects to the browser (for errors, usb/host mount/unmount
  and file/folder actions) - rather silly, just for demonstration of some
  SPU2 ADPCM decoding features;
- fixed a "crash" issue with some mp3 files (thanks to "sigmar" for the
  research/note);

Update (10-MAR-2006)
--------------------
- fixed "autoload subtitles" issue. Thanks to "suram884" for the remark;
- "Dolby Digital" passthrough mode (via S/PDIF optical output) is implemented
  (available through SMS Menu -> Player settings). Tested only with SoundBlaster
  PC sound card and 384kb/s ac3 streams. No volume adjustment is possible in
  this mode;
- fixed "Display Settings"/"TV system" menu issue (thanks to "Voldemar_u2" for
  the remark);
- fixed usb device hot swapping issue (bug in "usb_mass" device driver). Thanks
  to "hip203" for the research and note;

Update (16-MAR-2006)
--------------------
- Updated code for "Dolby Digital" output, so, any valid ac3 streams should be
  playable now (formerly only 5 channel streams were supported)(thanks to
  "lolo123" and "rathunter" for sample video clips);
- Added "play all mp3 files in the folder" functionality. It is activated by
  "circle" pad button while the folder is selected in the browser. Files are
  played in alphabethical order;
- USBD.IRX (free one, from ps2dev) is now integrated into SMS. No need for
  "external" usb driver anymore (thanks to "dlanor" for the suggestion);
- fixed "double speed ac3 sound" issue (thanks to "shiro" for the sample video
  clip);

Update (06-APR-2006)
--------------------
- Performance is improved (video decoder core is rewritten in assembler using
  R5900 CPU multimedia instructions). Mainly this affects video clips encoded
  with QPel/GMC options (these are kinda watchable now) though playback of
  "usual" video clips also got a bit smoother;
- Some motion compensation related bugs in video decoder are fixed and new ones
  are added :);

Update (10-APR-2006)
--------------------
- Fixed bug in video decoder (QPel motion compensation related). Thanks to "Crash"
  for sample video clip;
- Fixed scrollbar issue in the player (on-screen garbage in some cases);

Update (27-APR-2006)
--------------------
- Updated MP3 related code to deal with LAME-encoded files (thanks to
  "KanedA_PL" for the sample audio clip);
- Added "randomize playlist" and "repeat" options to the MP3 player.
  Note: "repeat" mode is applicable for both "m3u" and "mp3" files;
- Implemented rather primitive "audio spectrum display" feature during
  mp3 playback (8 bars for the left channel and 8 for the right one).
  It's not very precise for sample rates different from 48000Hz (since
  upsampling is performed on IOP side), but it just adds some fanciness
  to the "flying balls";
- Slightly improved performance of the MP3 decoder (assembler
  implementation of the 64-bit integer multiplication routine);

Update (10-MAY-2006)
--------------------
- Fixed "zero volume" bug in the player. Thanks to "wallacee" for the remark;
- An attempt has been made to get rid of "hangings" for "badly interleaved .avi"
  (thanks to "Mr.Worm~~" for sample video clip);
- Changed subtitle selectsion logic. Now pressing "triangle" button in the
  "minibrowser" cancels default subtitle selection ("dlanor's" suggestion);
- Audio spectrum is made "symmetric" ("rathunter's" suggestion);
- "Audio animation display" menu option is moved to "MP3 settings..." submenu;
- Timer code is rewritten;

Update (25-MAY-2006)
--------------------
- changed image management routines. Now SMS uses unified image format for
  skin and icons. IPU is fully utilized to perform image decompression (it's
  quite fast (a 640x480 test image is decompressed from 30KB to 900KB and
  uploaded to GS memory in just ~8ms)). A Win32 application (pic2smi.exe) is
  provided to create such an images. This application is replaced an old one
  (pic2sms.exe). It's possible to adjust image quality (better quality - bigger
  image size) and brightness, but default settings should work OK in most cases.
  These changes resulted smaller (by ~110KB uncompressed) SMS.elf size. Note new
  skin filename: SMS.smi ('i' means "image" :)) (thanks to "Mr. Worm~~" for
  trying it);
- high resolution movies are performing using reduced color resolution
  (dithered 16 bit), so no artefacts due to insufficient GS RAM should occur.
  There's also a possibility to force desired color resolution via SMS menu
  as 16 bit color resolution can improve performance a bit (less data traffic).
  (thanks to "Mr. Worm~~" again for trying);
- non-interleaved .avi's are treated as "unsupported". File treated as
  non-interleaved if it contains more than 256 consecutive packets belonging
  to the same stream (audio, video or other);
- added function to copy selected file to HDD's current partition. Pressing
  "square" pad button activates file context menu which currently has only
  one item (Copy to HDD). Copy process can be terminated by "triangle" (there
  can be some delay due to buffering, so press and hold "triangle" till "Stopping"
  message will appear at the status line). This function is purely experimental
  (just to measure device speed), so, use it on your own risk :) (files will be
  overwritten without any prompt). Note also that only PS2 internal HDD is
  supported;

Update (06-JUL-2006)
--------------------
- fixed "...the .srt subtitle file which is selected by entering "Select subtitles"
  menu can't be loaded with .avi if they are stored in mass:..." bug. Thanks to
  "magusneo" for the remark;
- added remote control support and removed gamepad support for slot 1:
  * for PS2 models without built-in IR sensor AND WITH rom1:RMMAN module an external
    IR sensor should be plugged into slot 1;
  * for PS2 models without built-in IR sensor AND WITHOUT rom1:RMMAN module SMS looks
    for mc0:/SMS/RMMAN.IRX module which is just a copy of rom1:RMMAN module from PS2
    models where this module is present. An external IR sensor should be plugged into
    slot 1;
  * for PS2 models with built-in IR sensor an external IR sensor has no effect;
  * for PS2 models without built-in IR sensor AND without rom1:RMMAN module AND
    without mc0:/SMS/RMMAN.IRX module remote control support is disabled;
  * Button mappings in SMS file browser:
    - "Reset"    - turns console off;
    - "Enter"    - equivalent to "cross" gamepad button;
    - "Play"     - equivalent to "cross" gamepad button;
    - "A-B"      - display about;
    - "Menu"     - display SMS menu;
    - "Top menu" - activate device browser menu (ignored in the device browser);
    - "Subtitle" - equivalent to "circle" gamepad button (ignored in the device browser);
    - "Program"  - equivalent to "square" gamepad button (ignored in the device browser);
    - "Return"   - equivalent to "triangle" gamepad button (ignored in the device browser);
  * Button mappings in SMS player:
    - "Pause"   - pause;
    - "Menu"    - player menu;
    - "Play"    - resume;
    - "Reset"   - equivalent to "triangle" gamepad button;
    - "Return"  - equivalent to "triangle" gamepad button;
    - "Stop"    - equivalent to "triangle" gamepad button;
    - "Scan >>" - equivalent to "right" gamepad button;
    - "Scan <<" - equivalent to "left" gamepad button;
    - "Display" - equivalent to "square" gamepad button;
    - "Time"    - equivalent to "cross" gamepad button;
    - "Audio"   - equivalent to "circle" gamepad button;

Note that in order to get remote control (with "external" IR sensor) working while
preserving gamepad and memory card functionalities unaffected a modified SIO2MAN
module is created (based on Marcus R. Brown code from SVN and my own disassembly
works) and integrated into SMS (source code of it can also be found in SVN).
THERE'S NO WARRANTY THAT OTHER DEVICES LIKE MULTITAP ETC. WILL WORK WITH IT.
Thanks to "Mr.Worm~~" and "Rathunter" for testing;

- added 'FMP4' fourcc recognition. Thanks to "ntt2005" for the research/note;
- added support for "simple" M3U list. Only relative paths are supported;
- updated some IOP drivers from ps2sdk;

Update (01-SEP-2006)
--------------------
- DTV 480p video mode support added. Note: not tested here;
- added menu option to configure controller port 2. There're 3 options:
  - gamepad: remote control is disabled and controller port 2 is configured
             for gamepad;
  - remote control: controller port 2 is configured for the official remote control
                    with external IR sensor plugged into controller slot 2;
  - none: controller port 2 is disabled and support for the official remote control
          with built-in IR sensor is enabled;
  Notes: second option will appear only if there's no rom1:RMMAN2 module;
- added brightness control to the player. Use 'L2' gamepad button to decrease
  brightness and 'R2' to increase it;
- added high precision mode to the MP3 decoder. Sound appears better in this mode but
  it's more demanding in computational sense. This mode is always on for audio files
  and it's selectable for video files via SMS menu;
- fixed cdvd driver (ISO9660:1999 mode). Thanks to 'Voldemar_U2' for the research and
  implementation;
- added support for arabic subtitles. Activated by
  "SMS menu->Player Settings->Subtitle Alignment->right" option. I'm not sure if I did
  it correctly (original strings are reversed and displayed right aligned), so any
  comments are welcome. Thanks to 'ALI' for explanations;
- updated USB drivers;
- network drivers are slightly optimized resulting a bit faster network transactions
  (I've got ~690KB/s while transferring a video file to the hard disk);

Update (20-SEP-2006)
--------------------
- fixed "image flicker" in DTV 480P video mode (thanks to "jacky401" for the
  note);
- hopefully fixed SMS crash if pause or menu is activated at the beginning of playback;
- 2 VESA video modes (640x480@60Hz and 640x480@75Hz) are added;
- changed logical screen width in DTV480p mode from 640 to 720 (I'm not sure if this is
  correct or not);
- this update uses VU0 unit to compute IDCT for intra macroblocks in micro mode, so,
  there's some performance gain in video decoding (~6%);
- there're also some experiments with thread priorities in the player, so there's no
  warranty that this1 thing will not hang during playback :);

Update (16-OCT-2006)
--------------------
- new MPEG audio decoder code. Fast (~40% faster than low precision one in the previous
  version), precise (uses floating point calculations) and supports MPEG 1.0 layers 1, 2
  and 3. For calculations VU0 (macro and micro modes) and VU1 (micro mode) are used;
  Note: layer 1 audio is not tested as I couldn't find any files encoded in this format.
  Thanks to 'mpg123' project creators/maintainers for the source code;
- 'ffgriever''s code (.txt subtitles) is integrated (thanks to him (her) for adding some
  code into this maze :));
- brighness control is updated a bit (if maximum is selected then a fixed value of 32 is
  added to each color component to make the whole image "brighter");
- some other internal changes (an attempt to eliminate "choppy playback" at the beginning
  of the movie playback (this can result longer pause at movie startup and during scrolling);

Update (20-OCT-2006)
--------------------
- fixed "bad sound from mp3 joint-stereo audio" bug
  (thanks to lee99 for the sample clip);
- fixed ".avi files with 'txts' chunk detected as mp3" bug
  (thanks to 'Z-Saber' for the sample clip);
- added possibility to playback .avi files with mp1/mp2 audio;
  (thanks to 'vitaliyfx' for the sample clip);
- added 'page-up/page-down' actions to the filebrowser (L1/L2 pad buttons);
- added '.mpa/.mp2' media filter to the filebroser;
- there's another guess about 480p mode;
- fixed 'SMS hangs when resumed from pause' bug;
  (thans to 'spkleader' for the note);
- fixed incorrect integration 'ffgriever''s code (.txt subtitles);

Update (24-OCT-2006)
--------------------
- fixed bugs related to mp3 sound glitches and m3u crashes;
  (thanks to 'lee99' for notes, patience and music);

Update (04-DEC-2006)
--------------------
- network driver is optimized further (host->hdd transfer rate is
  about 860 KB/s here and raw download speed is about 900KB/s);
- new data packet management -> the application might be unstable,
  since it was not tested a lot;
- sound driver is updated a bit;
- widescreen code of 'hjx' is integrated;
- added dynamic scrollbar scale (L1/R1 padd buttons during scroll);

Update (09-DEC-2006)
--------------------
- fixed "dynamic scrollbar scale" issue (thanks to 'peterdcrees' for
  the remark;
- speed up network driver once again a tiny bit (almost 900KB/s
  transfer speed to HDD here);
- changed A/V synchronization algorithm (image motions should appear
  smoother);

Update (24-DEC-2006)
--------------------
- added SMB/CIFS network protocol. Tested only on Windows XP Pro (SP2)
  and Linux/Debian with recent Samba distribution. Only one server
  connection is supported (though driver allows two). Network transfer
  speed is comparable to host: protocol (if the server supports raw data
  transfer (both XP and Linux do), otherwise it will be ~30% slower).
  To use this feature perform following steps:
  - create SMS.smb text file in a text editor. This file must contain
    exactly 5 lines in the following order:
    - IP address of the SMB server (ex. 192.168.0.3);
    - name of the SMB server       (ex. MyServer);
    - name of the PS2 (arbitrary)  (ex. MyPS2);
      Note: I'm not 100% sure about it, maybe this name
            must be listed in 'hosts'/'lmhosts' file;
    - user name used for authentication (ex. eugene);
    - user password used for authentication (ex. myPassword);
      Note 1: blank password is not allowed;
      Note 2: - "for individuals that think that harm is occurring, or
                 is going to occur, to him or her"
              - "for individuals that think the persecutor has the
                 intention to cause harm"
              PASSWORD IS ONE WAY ENCRYPTED BEFORE ITS TRANSMISSION TO
              THE SMB SERVER ONLY IF THE SERVER SUPPORTS SUCH A FEATURE
              (at least Windows XP Pro(SP2) and Samba on Libux/Debian do
              support this (please, don't consider this as advertisement));
  - make sure that IP address is correct;
  - make sure that SMB server name is correct;
  - make sure that SMB server allows connections (i.e. review firewall/router
    settings);
  - make sure that user whose credentials supplied in SMS.smb has appropriate
    access rights to connect to the SMB server;
  - copy this file to mc0:/SMS folder;
  - start SMS; If 'autostart network' option is active, then
    deactivate it, save settings and restart SMS;
  - goto SMS menu -> Device settings;
  - select SMB/CIFS network protocol;
  - start network support;
  New device icon shall appear as soon as connection to the server is
  established (or error message if there's a problem with authentication
  etc.). Normally this should occur in 0-10 seconds. There's no need to
  start SMB server before SMS, as connection is made automatically (SMS tries
  to establish connection to the server approximately each 5-10 seconds).
  It's possible to shut down SMB server while SMS browser is active. In this
  case SMB device icon will disappear and connection attempts are resumed again.
  This can however cause hang, so use this functionaliy at your own risk; 
  In case of problems use 'ethereal'/'wireshark' software to trace activity on
  the server's TCP port 139. New SMB device is browseable starting from share
  level (note that shares with '$' suffix in their name (like 'C$', 'ADMIN$'
  etc.) are explicitly disabled, so they won't ever appear in the file browser);
- increased packet buffer size in attempt to avoid audio.video 'stutter'
  (this results longer delays at startup and during scrolling);
- changed '-' and '_' character indentation to prevent overlapping
  (thanks to 'shassino' for the remark);
- added UTF8 subtitles support (thank to 'Npl' for the implementation);
