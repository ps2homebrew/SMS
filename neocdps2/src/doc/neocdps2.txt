History:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

0.5   - Triple Buffering using vsync callback 
        (thanks to drakonite for the idea)
      - CD now stop spinning once in the "insert" screen 
        which should help people using swap method.
      - Fixed auto-animation speed (thx mame)
      - Bit better sound emulation, but still not perfect
      - Settings are now saved to MC, and restored at start-up
      - Basic frameskip routine (off by default)
      - Added an error message if bios is not found or invalid.
      - source clean-up
     

0.4   - Modified CD detection/swap routines, should work better now.
	(Press (X) a second time if cd not detected the first time)
      - Added a workaround for the ps2ip bug (repeated small reads).
        should fix loading with all  version.
      - Corrected ipl.txt parsing routines.
        fix Double Dragon hang up during loading, and probably others.
      - Corrected a bug introduced in last version and preventing from
        loading a game located in "cd" folder when booting from CD.
      - Added the Samurai Spirit RPG patch.
      - Implemented use of "GfxPipe" for gfx rendering.
        Almost all games I've tested are fullspeed without sfx, and still 
        with the old 68k core (who said the ps2 wasn't able to handle it?)
      - Fixed "blinking sprite" gfx bug, no more missing vertical sprites
        in horizontal scrolling games.
      - Added NGCD memory card saves, Neocd will create a 45k file on 
        your memory card if available (memory card in slot 1 only)
      - Corrected support for PSX pads (7not6)
      - In-Game Menu (region selector, sound activation, etc.. see below)
      - added some gfx filter effect and a fullscreen option (to remove
        black border in PAL video mode), see menu description.
      - Correct cpu count cycles (68k core was running at 10Mhz in PAL)
        will be a bit slower but timing will be more accurate
      - Lowered Z80 frequency to 4Mhz (was "overclocked" to 6Mhz)
      - Changed the z80 to a more portable one (fixed sfx in lots of games)
      - Preliminary sound support (buggy and to be optimized)
        use ingame menu to enable/disable it, and consider it just as a 
        preview, since the code is still wip and still need to be work on.
        (thx to lkz with help on fixing THE "freezing" bug with sound)
      - "All-In-One" packed elf with embedded IRX and neocd files (<300kb), 
        only bios still need to be present (for legal reason) in the root 
        directory, see usage for new instructions.
      - Included installation script for the Crystal Chip Boot Manager
                  
0.3   - Compatibily greatly increased (no more sprites/tiles missing).
	thanks so much to Ian for the very very helpull tip !
      - In game "freezing" fixed.
      - Memory save "crash" fixed.
      - Added 2nd controller support & analog controls
      - Added possibility to disable z80 emulation.
      - Optimized rendering code (still not fullspeed for all games).
      - Corrected HDD/MC support ("should" work now, untested).
      - Checks local "cd" folder before asking to swap CD.
      - Rewrote CD reading/swapping code using Hiryu CDVD library.
      	no more iso9660 limitations (max 31 files in root dir, ...)
      	and cd swap issue should be fixed.
      - Removed loading of memcard.bin (useless empty file)
      - Removed need for timer.irx (not used anymore)
      - Automatically set region (EUR for pal ps2, USA for ntsc ps2)

            
0.2a  - Mainly a bug fix regarding the loading/booting code :
        Lots of people had problems while running the emulator,
        so I made a more robust code that should allow it to run
        even launched from your toaster now !
        (MC and HDD not tested, but code is there)
      - Fixed controller bug (was not responding after a while).


0.1a  - First release !
      	As this is an alpha release, this emulator is in 
	the very early stages of production and a lot still 
	need to be done. Compatiblity rate is low : 
	some games are playable, but others have gfx glitches, 
	no graphics at all, or just hangs up after a while.
	(games like Bust a Move are fully playable)
      	And there is no sound yet.
      	

Introduction:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

NeoCD/PS2 is a open source NeoGeo CD emulator running on the
Sony Playstation 2. It is a port of NeoCD/SDL, the excellent
NeoGeo CD emulator by Foster. Since there is actually no SDL
library on the PS2, all SDL portions have been removed and 
replaced by PS2 "native" libraries (using PS2SDK). 

NeoCD/PS2 is not endorsed by SNK Playmore in any way and is 
produced without the use of any copyrighted material which 
belongs to Sony Computer Entertainment Inc, or SNK Playmore, 
or any other party.   

NeoCD/PS2 should only be used to play games that the user legally 
owns. NeoCD/PS2 must never be distributed with any copyrighted 
games or other material. Any breach of these terms is out of the 
authors control and is not at the authors consent. 

NeoCD/PS2 is a free sofware. You may copy and distribute it as 
much as you like assuming that you respect the above conditions.

The NeoCD/PS2 source code is distributed under the terms of the 
GNU General Public License.

Current Features:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Very Good compatibilty
- PAL/NTSC auto-detection
- MC/HDD support
- Loads games from the cdrom
- 2 controllers support
- NGCD memory card support (use 45K on the MC)
- Stereo sound emulation
- Ingame menu

Current Issues:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Sound emulation sometime slowdown emulation
- Sound is buggy ("echo" in MS, missing sfx in KOF '99, etc.. ) when 
  framerate is not full.
- Timing issues
- Graphics glitches during KOF loading
- It's not possible to exit from the bios (ps2 reset needed!)
- .. and probably others !

To-do list:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Improve/Optimize/Finish sfx and fm sound emulation
- Add Stef's cz80 & 68k Core
- Rewrite gfx routines using gsKit
- Add CDDA support
- Implement Raster effect (Pleasure Goal, etc..)
- ISO support ?
- AES/MVS support ?
- more ?

If you would like a feature that is not listed above, please 
contact me with your idea (see below).


Usage:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

General requirements :

- Before running the emulator be sure that the "host/cd" 
  contains the following tree :

  |-- neocd folder (or CD root)
    |
    |- neocd.bin (ngcd bios, not provided)
    |
    |- neocd.elf
    |
    |- neocdps2.txt
    |
    |- system.cnf (if burned on a cd)
    |
    |- install.pbt  \
    |- instlst.pbt   \_ C.C. Boot Manager Install Scripts
    |- remove.pbt    /  Needed to install neocd on the BM
    |- run.pbt      /
    
  Before you ask, if ANY file is MISSING : IT WON'T WORK !

- Ensure that the neocd bios file (called "neocd.bin") is 
  present it should not be compressed (file is 512kb big).
  a correct bios should have his CRC32 equal to 0xDF9DE490
  -> neocd.bin is NOT provided with the emulator, so you have 
  to search it by your own or try to dump it from your NGCD.
  
- Load the emulator (neocd.elf) using your favorite way. If you 
  burn the emulator be sure to use mode1/iso9660/NO multisession.

- On the splash/intro screen, when you see the "Insert a CD" text, 
  insert a neogeo cd into your drive, wait a few seconds (the time 
  for the drive to spin) and press (X) on the pad.

- If all goes well NeoCD/PS2 should detect the game and run it.

Limitation on CD swapping :

1. Your ps2 will need to be modded, else cd will be only recognized 
   as Audio CD, and it won't be recognized by the emulator.

2. CD size must be at least of 30Mb. Depending of your model, your 
   ps2 could have problem reading/booting little games (i.e. bust a move), 
   so you will need to use a backup up copy and inject some dummy file.

General remarks :

1. Concerning loading from host, I use to test/debug the emulator :
     - PS2Link 1.30 / psclient v2.00
   So please try using the same one if you get problem with your 
   loader.(inlink is known to have problems loading it)

2. If running the emulator from host (or any other way not using the 
   cd swap), you can copy all files of a game under a "cd" directory
   that will need to be in the neocd folder. The emulator will first
   try for the folder existence and execute the game being inside.  
   
3. It could be possible to copy the files from your original CD and to 
   burn them together with the emulator. It's highly recommend to put 
   the game files directly in the cd root instead of under the "cd" 
   folder when burning a game together with the emulator on a CD.

4. HDD should be supported but under certain conditions : If used using 
   regular way of loading (CDROM) it won't works if loaded with fakehost 
   or similar applications (since it redirects cdrom calls). Anyway some
   combination should be possible (see .3) ...


In-game controls:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

PS2         -       NEOCD
-------------------------
Arrows      =     A/D-Pad
Left stick  =     A/D-Pad
Cross	    =    Button A
Circle      =    Button B
Square      =    Button C
Triangle    =    Button D
Start       =       Start
Select      =      Select

L2 + R2	    = Ingame Menu


In-game Menu:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Resume     : Go back to current game
- Filter     : Video filter (Nearest or Linear)
	       with certain games, Linear filter is needed to correct 
	       some effect caused by the fullscreen video option.
- Fullscreen : Set video to fullscreen 
	       remove black border, PAL only !
- Frameskip  : Enable / Disable frameskip
	       It enable a frameskip of 1, that is more than enough.
- Sound	     : Turn sound on/off
- CDDA	     : Turn CDDA on/off (not implemented yet)
- Region     : Change console region 
	       you will need to reset the emulation to apply it.
- Enter Bios : needed if you want to format the memory card 
	       ou will need to restard the emulator to get out (!bug!)
- Soft Reset : Reset emulation

Additionaly by holding [Select] when in the ingame menu, you can change 
the screen position using the directional pad.

If changed, settings will be automatically saved to the memory card.
At start up, they will be automatically restored to the last saved value.
